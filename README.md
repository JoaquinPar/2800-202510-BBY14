## 2800-202510-BBY14

## Overview

Retirement Calculator - The goal of the application is to help users manage and track their financial progress in a way that reflects real life. Instead of just acting as a calculator, the app functions as a dynamic tracker. It shows the user a percentage of how much of their goal has been achieved and compares their actual performance to their planned targets.
